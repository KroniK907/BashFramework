BashFramework
=============
This is a Bash Script template which adds several features which are useful for any bash script. 

The features include:
- Allows options and arguments to be passed to the bash script
- A help text function which can be seen via -h 
- A debug command which allows you to echo things to the console but only when -v is set
- A pair of error handling functions which allow you to easily log errors and which commands caused them. 

Feel free to use or modify this.
