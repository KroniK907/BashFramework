BashFramework
=============
This is a Bash Script template which adds several features which are useful for any bash script. 

The features include:
- Allows options and arguments to be passed to the bash script (read up on getopts to make more use of this)
- A help text function which can be seen via -h 
- A debug command which allows you to echo things to the console but only when -v is set (soon to be replaced with log)
- A pair of error handling functions which allow you to easily log errors and which commands caused them.

Contribution
============
Feel free to submit pull requests for features you would like to see added.
