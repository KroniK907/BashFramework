KroniK's Bash Template
=============
In my year or so of heavy bash scripting I have ended up developing a template which includes many of the features I always seem to need. I'll try to keep this up to date as I add or develop parts of this template.  

The features include:
- Allows options and arguments to be passed to the bash script (read up on getopts to make more use of this)
- A help text function which can be seen via -h 
- A debug command which allows you to echo things to the console but only when -v is set (soon to be replaced with log)
- A pair of error handling functions which allow you to easily log errors and which commands caused them.

Feel free to submit pull requests for features you would like to see added.
